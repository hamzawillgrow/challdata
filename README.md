# Project Title: Challenge Data 35

This challenge focuses on the topic of large-scale product type code multimodal (text and image) classification where the goal is to predict each productâ€™s type code as defined in the catalog of Rakuten France. 
In this project, I am going to restrict to the text analysis, it can go further in the future if time is provided
